# Juni Hackathon Submission

Welcome to my submision to the Juni Learning Hackathon (May 2020, JV division). This is a Flask app that uses a [Keras](https://keras.io) DNN to detect Parkison's Disease. My entry video is available [here](https://google.com).

## Who

My name is Gideon Grinberg, and I have been programming for ~9 months. My first programming language was Python, but while we are all out of school, I have learned Javascript, [SQLite](https://sqlite.org), and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) online, and I am really happy to have gotten to use these in this project, even if not every piece made it into the final version.

## What

I made a CNN using PyTorch and FastAI. The CNN detects Parkinson's Disease based on a Archimedes Spiral drawn by the test subject. It is my hope that this can be used as a cheap, at-home test that could allow for earlier detection of this disease. Please see the [acknowledgements]("#Acknowledgements") section for more information on the methodolgies the program uses.

## Acknowledgements

The dataset is availble under the Creative Commons License, and based on a 2019 paper. I modified the dataset's structure for this project. I got the idea for this project from [PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com)
